	<h2>Explanation:</h2>
	<p>
		This project was the result of a question that came up on my blog post about programmaticly resetting the history of a navigation stack for an individual tab.
	</p>
	<h3>Normal Tab:</h3>
	<p>
		The Movies tab will maintain the normal navigation flow, so when a user navigates from the first page to the second page, leaving and re-entering the Movies tab will not reset the nav stack.  The user will re-enter at whichever of those pages they last saw activated.
	</p>
	<h3>Reset Tab:</h3>
	<p>
		The Bands tab will always reset back to the root of the nav stack - that being the band listing.  In order to do this, I handled the <code>ionSelect</code> event on the Bands tab, and analyzed its internal <code>_views</code> property.  That functionality can probably be extended to build some deeper navigational programming.  You can find the code that provides that functionality in <code>app/pages/tabs/tabs.ts</code>.
	</p>
	<h3>To test:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Tap on the Bands tab</li>
		<li>Tap on any band to view a list of that band's songs</li>
		<li>Tap on the Movies tab</li>
		<li>Tap on any movie to see a song or two from its soundtrack</li>
		<li>Tap on the Bands tab again</li>
		<li><strong>You should be brought back to the list of bands</strong></li>
		<li>Tap on the Movies tab again</li>
		<li><strong>You should be brought back to the list of songs from the movie you previously selected</strong></li>
	</ul>
